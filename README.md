# Simple Web Crawler

Simple web crawler: given a starting URL, the crawler visits each URL it finds on the same domain. It prints each URL visited, and a list of links found on that page. The crawler is limited to one subdomain - so when you start with *https://wikipedia.org/*, it crawls all pages on the wikipedia.org website, but dont follow external links, for example to facebook.com.
